want to use binary tree to store heap, and cannot use array, so:
    read in args and insert nodes into tree as priority queue
    run heapify after each insert so queue is in order
    once tree is complete, pop off root and form queue
        inserting things @ back takes constant time w/ tail pointer
        removing and printing from front takes constant time b/c just need to move head pointer to next item in stack
